# ðŸ”’ Security Features

The Discord License Manager Bot implements robust security measures to protect your license data and prevent abuse. This page outlines the key security features built into the system.

## User Authentication and Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control

The bot implements a granular permission system:

- **User Level**: Basic commands like verification and redemption
- **Moderator Level**: License assignment and management
- **Admin Level**: Full access to all commands including configuration

Access is controlled through:
- Discord user IDs (specific users)
- Discord role IDs (role-based permissions)
- Channel restrictions (limit where commands can be used)

### Multi-Factor Authentication

For critical operations:
- Confirmation prompts for destructive actions
- Secondary verification for bulk operations
- Token-based verification for dashboard access

## API Security

### Authentication

The REST API uses a secure authentication system:

- **API Keys**: Unique keys with granular permissions
- **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived access tokens for sessions
- **HMAC Validation**: Request signing for enhanced security

### Rate Limiting

Protection against brute force attacks and API abuse:

- Configurable request limits (default: 100 requests per 15 minutes)
- IP-based and token-based rate limiting
- Exponential backoff for repeated violations
- Comprehensive logging of rate limit hits

### Request Validation

- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Parameter sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Schema validation using JSON Schema
- Request size limits to prevent DoS attacks

## Data Protection

### License Key Security

- Cryptographically secure random generation
- Format obfuscation with game-specific prefixes
- Unique identifiers to prevent collisions
- Validation checks to prevent typos and errors

### Sensitive Data Handling

- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) protection
- Optional email hashing for privacy
- Data minimization principles applied
- Configurable data retention policies

### Database Security

- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Connection pooling with timeout management
- Transaction support for data integrity
- Automated database backups

## Logging and Auditing

### Comprehensive Logging

- **Request Logging**: All HTTP requests logged with Morgan
- **Application Logging**: Structured logging with Winston
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logs with stack traces
- **Audit Trail**: All license operations logged for accountability

### Log Management

- Log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- Log levels for different environments (development, production)
- Sensitive data redaction in logs
- Optional integration with external logging services

## Infrastructure Security

### Database Backup System

- **Scheduled Backups**: Automatic database backups on configurable schedule
- **Rotation System**: Maintains multiple backup versions (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Encryption**: Optional backup encryption
- **Validation**: Integrity checks on backup files
- **Remote Storage**: Option to store backups on remote servers

### Error Handling

- Graceful failure handling to prevent information leakage
- Custom error messages for different scenarios
- Fallback mechanisms for critical functions
- Self-healing procedures for common issues

## Bot-Specific Security

### Command Throttling

- Cooldown periods for sensitive commands
- User-specific and global command rate limits
- Anti-spam measures for high-volume requests

### Interaction Timeouts

- Automatic cancellation of long-running operations
- Session management for multi-step commands
- Idle timeout for security-sensitive operations

## Client Security

### C# Integration Security

- License data encryption in client applications
- Hardware binding to prevent license sharing
- Tamper-resistant validation routines
- Obfuscation compatibility for client-side code

### Communication Security

- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- TLS 1.2+ requirement for secure connections
- Certificate validation to prevent MITM attacks
- Secure WebSocket for real-time dashboard updates

## Best Practices

### For Server Administrators

- Host the bot on a dedicated server or VM
- Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx) with additional security headers
- Set up a firewall to restrict access to API and dashboard ports
- Keep Node.js and dependencies updated
- Run the bot with minimal permissions

### For Bot Administrators

- Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens
- Limit admin access to trusted individuals
- Monitor the audit logs for suspicious activity
- Create regular database backups
- Test the recovery process periodically

### For Users

- Keep license keys confidential
- Don't share licenses between multiple users
- Report suspicious activity to administrators
- Use strong passwords for associated accounts

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. Do not disclose it publicly
2. Contact the project maintainers directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before disclosure

Responsible disclosure is appreciated and will be acknowledged.
